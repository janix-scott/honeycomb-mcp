# Project Status

## Current State
- Working branch: `test/trigger-workflow`
- Repository: Fork of honeycomb-mcp (janix-scott/honeycomb-mcp)
- GitHub Actions: Successfully configured and running

## Recent Progress

### GitHub Actions Configuration
1. Successfully set up workflow triggers for:
   - Manual workflow dispatch
   - Pull requests to main branch
   - Push events to main and trigger-workflow branches

2. Resolved workflow issues:
   - Fixed merge conflicts in `.github/workflows/mcp-compliance.yml`
   - Configured required repository secrets:
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
     - `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY`
   - Successfully tested workflow execution with secrets

### Workflow Files
1. `mcp-compliance.yml`:
   - Configured for compliance testing
   - Set up to run on PR and push events
   - Includes proper badge and report generation

2. `tests.yml`:
   - Configured for running tests and evaluations
   - Successfully running with Node.js matrix testing (18.x, 20.x)
   - Evaluation threshold set to 50% for passing criteria

## Next Steps
1. Continue with PR process:
   - PR from `test/trigger-workflow` to `main` in fork
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Review and merge changes

2. Future Improvements:
   - Consider adjusting evaluation thresholds based on results
   - Monitor and optimize workflow performance
   - Consider adding more comprehensive test coverage

## Environment Setup
- Using pnpm for package management
- Node.js environments: 18.x and 20.x
- Python environment: 3.12 (for compliance testing)

## Notes
- All GitHub Actions workflows are now properly configured with necessary secrets
- Successfully resolved merge conflicts and workflow execution issues
- Current setup allows for both local testing and CI/CD pipeline execution
